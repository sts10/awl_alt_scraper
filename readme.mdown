# Awl Alt Text Scraper

Earlier this week [Balk](https://twitter.com/AlexBalk) tweeted:

So I wrote this scraper to get every [Awl](http://www.theawl.com/) post with that had an image in its first `<p>` tag. `runner.rb` uses Ruby 2.3.0 to do this. It puts the `post_url`, `image_src`, and `image_alt` into a CSV (actually two different CSVs, one with everything and the other with just the images that had any alt text). 

The two CSVs: [all](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sts10/awl_alt_scraper/master/csv/archive1.csv); [just those with alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sts10/awl_alt_scraper/master/csv/just_with_alt.csv). Feel free to use as you like! I probably didn't manage the commas in the alt text that well? 

I then made a little site, `index.html` ([live demo](http://samschlinkert.com/awl-alt-tags/#)) to display these three pieces of information from each of 6,000+ posts that had images with alt text. Yay!

And here's [a blog post](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2016/05/07/website-scraped/) about this project.
